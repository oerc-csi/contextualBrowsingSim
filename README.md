# contextualBrowsingSim
Simulation of three contextual browsing strategies for ASIST 2018 submission: "Serendipity in Context - Prioritised Contextual Browsing in Large-Scale Digital Libraries"

simulationData.tgz contains two datasets generated by successive runs of simulate.Rmd: 
once with PROP_ADDITIONS = .2, PROP_DELETIONS = .2 (steady state), 
once with PROP_ADDITIONS = .1, PROP_DELETIONS = .3 (narrowing)

Load these (one at a time) into your R environment and run the chunks in analyse.Rmd to replicate the ks.tests and draw the plots described in the submission.
